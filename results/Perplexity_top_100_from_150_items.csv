¼ cup chopped fresh parsley leaves

Salt & pepper to taste

4 ounces cream cheese, softened

8 oz. cooked asparagus spears, trimmed and cut into 1/16″ thick slices

He has not yet been charged with any crime but will be questioned as part of the probe into possible Islamist militant activity, the source added. The arrest comes just days before President Francois Hollande's planned visit to Israel.
 the source told Reuters that investigators were looking into whether there might be links between the suspect and Islamic State militants who carried out attacks last year in Paris and Brussels.

Hydropower & Dams,"Hydropower & Dams

The United States has the largest number of dams in the world, with more than 1,000. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) estimates that there are about 2,500 dams on public lands and private property across the country. These include hydroelectric facilities such as Hoover Dam, which is located near Las Vegas; the Three Gorges Dam in China's Sichuan Province; and the Grand Coulee Dam in Washington State. In addition to these large-scale projects, many smaller dams have been built throughout the nation over time. For example, a dam was constructed at Lake Mead in Nevada in 1936 for use by the Army Corps of Engineers during World War II. Today, this reservoir provides water for irrigation purposes and also serves as an emergency backup supply for Southern California. Other small dams can be found along rivers like the Mississippi River or the Missouri River. Some of these smaller dams were built before the federal government began regulating hydropower development. Others were built after the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972.

In recent years, some states have begun to regulate the construction of new dams. However, most state regulations do not apply to existing dams because they are considered ""public works."" This means that any person who wishes to build a dam",4.182315349578857,1.4485141616413828,1.2009240474962166,492.7089541989326,1.36576129394796,4.029611587524414
Expanding the Third Reich,"Expanding the Third Reich's reach into Europe

The Nazis' expansionist ambitions were not limited to Germany. The Nazi regime also sought to expand its influence in other European countries, including Austria and Czechoslovakia. In 1938, Hitler ordered his foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop to begin negotiations with Austrian Chancellor Kurt Waldheim on a possible alliance between the two nations.[1] However, this plan was never carried out due to the outbreak of World War II.

In 1939, Adolf Hitler began an invasion of Poland that would eventually lead to the German occupation of most of Eastern Europe by 1941. During the war, the Germans occupied much of Western Europe as well, including France, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Yugoslavia, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, Croatia, Slovakia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia and Russia (the Soviet Union). They also invaded parts of China, North Africa, India, Burma, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, South America, and Antarctica.

The builder method is used to create a map with the specified title and description, which will be displayed in your app's main activity. The build() method then creates an instance of the ViewModel class that represents the map. You can use this object as you would any other ViewModel, but it also has some additional methods for displaying information about the current location on the screen:

public void setCurrentPosition(int x, int y) { // Set the position of the map here } public boolean getCurrentLocation() { return m_currentPos; }

― Dickey Betts,"― Dickey Betts, RHP

The Red Sox have been linked to a number of pitchers in the past few weeks. The most recent was David Price, who is now with Detroit and has reportedly agreed on a deal worth $217 million over seven years. Boston also had interest in Zack Greinke before he signed his extension last week. But it's not like they're going to be able to get all their needs filled by trading for free agents or signing players through international signings. So what do you do? You go out and sign one of your own. That's exactly what the Red Sox did this offseason when they acquired right-hander Dickey from the Blue Jays. He'll join an already strong rotation that includes Rick Porcello, Clay Buchholz, Eduardo Rodriguez, Steven Wright, Wade Miley, and Andrew Miller. It will take some time for him to adjust to the big leagues but if he can stay healthy, he could become a solid No. 3 starter. -- Dan Szymborski

It's been an interesting journey so far, but it has also brought with it some great opportunities that will help shape who I am in the future.


I've had many people ask about what they can do to make their lives better. One thing that comes up over and over again is ""how can I get out of debt?"" The answer is simple: you don't have to pay off your credit card balance or mortgage until you are financially independent. You may be able to save money by cutting back on unnecessary expenses like cable TV, cell phone bills, etc., but if you're not making enough money to cover these costs then there isn't much point in saving at all. If you want to cut down on spending, start small. For example, instead of buying $100 worth of groceries each week, try to buy one item per month. This way you'll still feel satisfied when you finish eating, but you won't spend more than you earn every month. Another option would be to stop paying rent altogether. Rent should only cost you between $200-$300/month depending on where you live.",4.802964210510254,1.4011292349256266,1.158711129454133,432.0581346680091,1.061293421764951,4.833430767059326

The best anal sex toys are the ones that you can use with your partner. If you're looking for a toy to help ease penetration, then an anal plug is probably not going to be up your alley. But if you want something more substantial and comfortable, there's no better option than a butt plug. These plugs come in all shapes and sizes, but they tend to have a lot of girth (about 1 inch) so it will take some getting used to before you get into them. They also usually don't require any lube or water-based lubricant because they're made from silicone.

However, if you want to marry your fiancee before getting married yourself, this option may still work out well! If you're planning on marrying your fiancée after having met her/him in person, it's best to wait until you've gotten to know each other better before deciding whether or not to go ahead with marriage.

Yamaha's first motorcycle was introduced to the public on June 27th, 1985 at the New York International Auto Show. The YZF-R1 is a sporty and powerful two-stroke engine that produces an impressive 125 horsepower (100 kW) @ 6500 rpm and 100 foot pounds of torque (75 Nm) @ 4200 rpm. It has been said by many riders that it feels like riding a jet fighter! This bike also features a unique ""V"" shaped air intake system which allows for better airflow through the cylinder heads. In addition, this model uses a new type of clutch called a ""double action.""

Anillo Wing T-8,"Anillo Wing T-8

The Anillo is a very popular wing in the United States. It's also one of my favorite wings to make, and I've made it many times over the years. The recipe below will give you all the ingredients needed for this delicious wing. You can use any combination of chicken breasts or thighs that are about 1/2 inch thick (I like to buy boneless skinless chicken breast). If using thighs, cut them into strips first so they cook faster. For more information on how to prepare your own chicken, check out our How To Cook Chicken page!

It was created by Charles Schwab in 1956 to help investors track their investments over time. In addition to tracking the performance of individual stocks, it also tracks the overall value of the entire market.

The Dow Jones industrial average has been around since 1896 when it began with just 100 shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Since then, it's grown from $10 per share to more than $20 today. This means that every single day, millions of people are able to buy or sell shares of this company at any given moment.

The Foamex boards are the most popular and have been around for a long time. They're made of high quality foam, which is great because it's easy to clean up after use. The board itself has two sides that can be used as either a stand or a table top. It comes with four feet (two on each side) so you don't need any additional stands if you want to put your game in front of the TV. You also get an extra set of legs to make sure your games stay upright when they sit down. There are three different sizes available: Small, Medium, Large. I personally prefer the small size since it fits my gaming group better than the medium one does. If you plan on using this product for more than just playing video games, then I would recommend getting the larger version.

conditional product description 1,"conditional product description 1.0

The conditional product is a function that takes two arguments and returns the third argument if it's true, otherwise false. The first argument to this function must be an expression of type boolean, which can either be a literal or a variable name (see below). If you want to use a variable as your second argument, then you need to wrap it in parentheses:

(if (> x 0) ""yes"" (* y 2)) ; => ""no""

If you don't specify any values for the conditionals, they will default to being equal to each other. This means that if one of them evaluates to true, the other will evaluate to false. You may also provide multiple conditions by separating them with commas:
- (if (= x 3) (+ y 4)) ;=> ""-1"" - (if (< x 5) (- y 6))) ;=> ""+5""
.

Variable names are evaluated using camelCase when used inside expressions. For example, the following code uses variables named foo and bar :

foo = 42 bar = 43

You can access these variables from within the body of the conditional product by prefixing their names with @.

It involves creating new products, services or processes in order to improve customer experience, increase efficiency and reduce costs. The goal is to create an environment where customers are satisfied with their purchases and businesses thrive by providing better value for money.

The digital revolution has been driven by technology companies such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft who have created innovative ways to deliver information and entertainment to consumers at affordable prices.

The island was inhabited by the indigenous inhabitants for more than 10,000 years before Spanish settlers arrived there in 1532. In 1833, the first European settlement on the island took place when the Portuguese established their colony at San Pedro de Atacama. After that, it became part of the Kingdom of Portugal until 1898, when it joined to Spain as a province.

Amplifier Trainers,"Amplifier Trainers

The Amplifiers are the heart of your system. They're where all the power is coming from, and they need to be able to handle it! The most common type of amplifier is a Class A/B amp with an output impedance of 4 ohms or less (the lower the better). These amps have very low distortion levels, but their input impedances can get quite high as well. This means that you'll want to use them in series if possible. If you don't mind using two separate amplifiers for each channel, then this will work fine. However, if you do plan on running multiple channels at once, then you should consider getting a pair of Class AB amplifiers instead.

Class B Amplifiers

A class B amplifier has an output resistance of 8-16 Ohm. While these amps aren't nearly as efficient as class A's, they still sound great when driven hard enough. You may also find some class B amps available with higher output impedances than 16 Ohms. For example, many Class D amps come with outputs up to 32 Ohms, which makes them ideal for powering speakers.

You go in and see what kind of vibe is there. And then when you get out there, you realize that it's just as good if not better than any other place. The people are really friendly and welcoming. They've got some cool stuff on their wall too. There's also a lot of local bands playing here so it's always fun to check them out.

What do you think makes the music scene at San Francisco different from other cities?

I don't know if it's unique or not but I feel like it has its own personality. People come here for different reasons. Some people want to be part of something bigger; others just want to hang out with friends. But everyone seems to find something interesting about the city.

I'm not sure if this is a bug or intentional, but I've noticed that the game will sometimes crash when you try to use an item with no effect on your hero (e.g. Bottle). It's only happened once so far and it was in a match against a friend of mine who had just bought a Blink Dagger. The problem seems to be related to how items are handled by the client. If you have any ideas as to what might cause this please let me know!


The other thing I'd like to point out is that there were some minor graphical glitches during the last few days which may have been caused by my computer being too hot for its own good. This has now subsided though and everything should look fine again.

BELLEVUE - The city's main shopping district is located on Broadway between Pike Street and Olive Way, just north of downtown Bellevue. It has a variety of shops for all your needs including clothing stores, jewelry stores, department store chains, restaurants, coffee houses, bookstores, art galleries, movie theaters, and more. There are also many other businesses that cater to tourists such as hotels, bars, cafes, and even an ice cream parlor!


PARKING: Parking can be difficult at times due to heavy traffic during peak hours. If you plan ahead, it will help you avoid long lines or parking tickets. Most people park along the street near their destination. However, there are several lots within walking distance from the center of town. Some of these lot have free parking but others require payment. You may want to check with the business before visiting so they know what kind of fees apply. Also, if you're planning to stay overnight, make sure you get a good deal on parking because prices go up quickly after midnight.

 (Note: Free parking is available at the Bellevue Municipal Center Garage.)

The new law will also allow insurers to charge older Americans up to five times more than younger ones for coverage and impose a 30 percent surcharge on those who have pre-existing conditions. The average premium increase is expected to be about 20 percent over the next decade.
 of course, this means that if you are an old person with a serious illness or disability, your premiums could skyrocket as well. And it's not just seniors who stand to lose out: young people can expect their insurance costs to rise by double digits too.

The first time I saw this, it was in a book by the late Dr. Robert M. Pirsig called ""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"". It's about how to get your motorcycle up on its feet after you've crashed into something or have been involved in an accident. The author is very clear that he doesn't want to be preachy but rather wants to share his experience with others who may find themselves in similar situations.


I found myself reading through several chapters before I realized what the point of the story really was:


""If you're going to crash, don't try to fix it yourself.""


This is one of those things that seems obvious when you read it, but then you realize that there are people out there who will never understand why we do things like repair our own cars, bikes, etc., because they think that if we can just figure out how to make them run better, we'll all become rich overnight! This attitude has led many people down the wrong path where they spend their lives trying to improve their vehicles instead of enjoying life.

Pizza Hut Pizza Hut Pizza Huts Pizza Hut's Pizza Hut is a chain of pizza restaurants in the United States. It was founded by George Halas, who also started the NFL's Chicago Bears and later became owner of the Green Bay Packers. The company has been owned since 2005 by Yum! Brands Inc., which owns KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and other fast-food chains. In 2010, it merged with Domino's to form Papa John's International.


The name ""pizza"" comes from the Italian word for bread (porcini), as well as the Latin word for cheese (parmigiano). This may be why some people think that all pizzerias are made out of wood or stone; however, this isn't true at all. Most pizzeria owners use concrete floors, brick walls, and tile roofs. Some even have indoor plumbing. Many pizzeria owners prefer using fresh ingredients over frozen ones because they can control their own production process better than large corporations do. They're able to make sure that every slice tastes exactly how they want it to taste.

The first thing that struck me about the new book is how much it has changed since I last read it in 2009, when it was published by a different publisher and with an entirely different cover design. The second thing that strikes me is just how many of these changes are actually good ones: they're not just cosmetic or minor tweaks to make things look better on paper; rather, they represent significant improvements over what came before. This is especially true for the introduction, which now includes a list of all the books that have been written about the subject so far, as well as some brief biographical information about each author. It's also worth noting that this edition contains more than twice as many illustrations—more than half of them, in fact—as its predecessor did. And while there were no major additions to the text itself, several sections received substantial updates, including the section on ""the history of science"" and the chapter on ""science policy."" In addition, the index has been updated to include both the original and revised editions of the book, along with a few other useful items such as the names of the authors who contributed to the bibliography.

Vacuum schematic manual,"Vacuum schematic manual

The Vacuum is a very simple device. It consists of two parts: the vacuum tube and the condenser. The vacuum tube has an input coil, which can be made from any type of transformer (see below). A small capacitor in series with this coil will act as a voltage divider between the positive and negative terminals of the tube. This circuit produces a high-voltage signal that drives the output transistor to its maximum potential. When the vacuum tubes are connected together they form a single unit called a ""tube pair"". In order for the vacuum to work properly it must have a low impedance at all frequencies. If you connect one vacuum tube directly to another without using a resistor or other component to reduce the resistance then there will be no current flow through the connection. As long as the vacuum is not too close to the source of power the current flowing through the connections should never exceed about 1/10th of the supply voltage.


Figure 2 - Tube Pair Circuit Diagram

A common problem when working on vacuum tubes is that the vacuum may become hot enough to burn your fingers if you touch them while trying to remove the filament. To avoid this problem simply place the vacuum over a piece of paper towel or something similar so that the heat does not get into the tube itself",6.0848798751831055,1.388445137514358,1.2073726312279642,367.1488733112734,1.051531551822171,6.641656875610352
